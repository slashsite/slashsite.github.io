### [soaéraéfet]
<br/>
Around year 2080, a group of scientists called Soaéraéfet, which is "craft" in the ancient language of Awaé Baé Ubrum, discover how to access parallel dimensions. Before being able to reveal their discovery to the public, the scientist of Soaéraéfet fall into their machine and resurface in an alternate dimension...

### [time]
<br/>
Year 3672 : Most of the known world is in ruins. After countless of wars of unification, most of the world unite under one common central government. Or more under one alliance. The Federation of LaévaélSoaéraéfet conquered almost all of the known world but they aren’t really one country. The Federation of LaévaélSoaéraéfet is made of multiples states , often fighting each other to gain more power. The two main kingdoms were the Realm of Polarius and the Ladesian Kingdom / Empire. Both of them are friendly to each other. There is also one army under the Federation but not under any kingdom. The army of the end.
<br/>
In 3689 ASAR , a company located in Polarius , created robotic soldiers to defend the cities from the ravaging mobs roaming the land. Around two years later they collaborate with L.S.F. , a Ladesian scientific organization , to create elite soldiers. Infused with mystic ice , they are probably one of the most powerful soldiers to ever exist. At least at that time. Executor-Klasse and the Scharfschützenklasse. The Executor-Klasse is a very fast unit armed with an mystic ice and Diamond katana. They wear light but very protective armor. Their armor is mostly made of Diamond , black leather , obsidian and mystic ice. The Scharfschützenklasse is a slow but powerful ranged unit. They have enchanted bows as weapon and wear light black leather armor.

### [ASAR's advances]
<br/>
In 3695, ASAR comes out with it's Type2. 
<br/>
The Type2 units are a slightly more sophisticated version of Tpe1 units. One problem with them is that, in their quest to make them lighter and more compact, ASAR went light on the armor. 
<br/>
<br/>

### [Project 3]
<br/>
Year 3708. ASAR creates it's Type3 by using a new advanced brainchip from...<br/>
Soaéraéfet. The private lab survived the years. The original scientists are still there, although they are not quite 
human anymore. In fact, they lived long by transplanting themselves in their tactical doll type, the STD185. ASAR's new Type3 has the ability to recognise its owner, and now has a gridwide "reputation" system. All Type3 units communicate on a centralised server in Polarius and increase or decrease reputation of people based on what they see them do.
